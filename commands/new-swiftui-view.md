description: Scaffold a new SwiftUI view with proper state management, preview, and best practices
---

You are creating a new SwiftUI view. Please:

1. **Ask the user for details:**
   - View name (e.g., "ProfileView", "SettingsView")
   - Purpose and functionality
   - State requirements (simple @State, ObservableObject, @Observable)
   - Any data models needed

2. **Create the view with:**
   - Proper state management (@State, @StateObject, @Observable as appropriate)
   - SwiftUI best practices (extracted subviews, proper modifiers)
   - Accessibility labels where appropriate
   - Dark mode support
   - Dynamic Type support

3. **Include:**
   - Clear comments explaining key decisions
   - Preview provider with multiple states
   - Example usage in parent view

4. **Follow these principles:**
   - Keep view body under 10 lines (extract subviews)
   - Use appropriate property wrappers
   - Proper separation of concerns
   - Platform-appropriate patterns (iOS vs macOS)

Activate the `swiftui-essentials` skill for implementation guidance.
